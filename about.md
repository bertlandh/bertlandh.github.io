## About Me 

Hello and welcome! My name is C.S. Rhymes and I'm a full time frontend web developer, based in Brackley, Northants, and an author in my spare time.

## Development

### Web Development

I specialise in PHP and JavaScript frontend development and have learnt on the job and from reading online articles and blogs. I have over 11 years experience of web development and, as I'm sure many web developers would agree, have a wide skill set, ranging from frontend HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to server side PHP, ajax, command line build tools, such as Gulp and WebPack, to nginx and apache server configuration.

Web Development moves at a fast pace and I enjoy learning new techniques and using new tools to help make my work more rewarding. I especially enjoy working with the reactive JavaScript library Vue.js and the fantastic Laravel PHP framework.

If you are looking to start web development there are some great resources out there and if you encounter an issue, chances are someone else has encountered it too and posted the solution online. Get stuck in creating and learn as you go!

### Apps
One more small mention is the Project Name Generator app I have created, available on Android. More information is available on the [projects page](/projects).

### Themes

This website is built using the bulma-clean-theme, that is also built by me. It is a freely available gem theme that can be used with Jekyll. Full instructions are available on the [GitHub repo page](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme#installation).

Feel free to use this theme as a starting point for your Jekyll sites and take advantage of the [Bulma frontend framework](https://bulma.io/).

I have also made another theme for Jekyll powered blogs called [Mere Blog Theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/mere-blog-theme)

## Writing

### Blogging

One of the reasons I have made this site and the [blog](/blog) is to post development information that I discovered that may be useful to others. 

I also share my recent posts on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/chrisrhymes) if you would like to follow me on there.

### Books

Like a lot of people, I have always wanted to write a book, so I decided to become an author with the help of the self publication service available for Amazon Kindle. As a developer, I find the best way to learn about something new is to go out and try it. As well as writing, editing, then getting the book published, I then used it as a way of learning more about digital marketing to generate interest in the book. One result of that is this website.

I enjoyed writing and publishing the first book so much that I have now written a second book. Details of my books are available on the [books](/books/) page. 

### Short Stories

I have also written a few short stories. These can be found on my [stories](/stories) page and also on [Medium](https://medium.com/short-stories-by-cs-rhymes).
