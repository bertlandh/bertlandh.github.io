Just a quick message to let you know of a couple of promotions on my [books](/books/) on the Amazon UK kindle store. 

## How NOT to make a website

I have a special price reduction running from the 1st October 2014 until the 5th October 2014 in the Amazon UK webstore where it will be available for 99p, offering a 59% discount.

If you are looking at finding out more about websites, but are not technical and don't know where to start, then this is a great opportunity to buy this book at a reduced cost and learn more about the common mistakes that are made when people make websites.

## How NOT to use a smartphone

I have a **free book promotion** running from the 1st October 2014 until the 5th October 2014 in the Amazon UK webstore. 

This is a great opportunity to download my book at no cost, so why not let any friends and family know about it, especially those who are new to using a smartphone.
