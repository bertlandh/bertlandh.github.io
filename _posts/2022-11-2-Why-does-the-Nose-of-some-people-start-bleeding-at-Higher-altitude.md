# Why does the Nose of some people start bleeding at Higher altitude?

There is a counter-pressure (equal and opposite) in our body with respect to atmospheric pressure at normal altitudes. Atmospheric Pressure decreases with increasing altitude. Hence, as we move to higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is less compared to the blood pressure as human body takes some time to adjust to the changes in atmosphere pressure. 

As you climb higher, the amount of oxygen in the air decreases. This makes the air thinner and dryer, which can in turn cause the inside of your nose to crack and bleed.
Another reason why mostly the nose is affected is that, humidity also takes a dip at higher altitudes. As the nose is the region where there is continuous inflow and no outflow of air, the soft inner skin(mucosa) loses its moisture rapidly and develops micro cracks.

## First Aid:

Sit upright and tilt your head slightly forward. Pinch the soft part of your nose by applying pressure using thumb and a finger. Pinching sends pressure to the bleeding point on the nasal septum and often stops the flow of blood.

Breathe through your mouth while the nostrils are pinched.
After 10 minutes, check if the bleeding has stopped by releasing the pressure. If the bleeding hasn't stopped, reapply the pressure for another 10 minutes.

Apply an ice pack to your nose and cheeks. Cold will constrict the blood vessels and help stop the bleeding.
