It has been a long time since I last updated the design of my site and as a Frontend Developer it didn't seem right to wait any longer. I have used a variety of different frontend frameworks in the past, from Foundation, to Bootstrap, but this time I wanted something different, so with a cup of coffee in hand I started looking for something new.

When I started learning Vue.js I found a great series of videos on [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step) and within the videos it mentions a CSS only framework called [Bulma](http://bulma.io/).

This was a bit of a change to me. Normally I would use a framework that offered both CSS and JavaScript to make it easier and quicker to implement, but then if you are going to use Vue.js you only need the CSS aspect of a Framework so this is perfect for this use case.

I started using Bulma with Vus.js projects, such as the [times table maths quiz](http://www.csrhymes.com/times-tables/), and really started to enjoy the syntax and the simplicity of the classes and styles. The biggest advantage was that it used flexbox by default, meaning you can do things like vertically align content with ease. It also means you can make use of auto adjusting with of columns when you add more, or make one narrow and the other expanded.

Previously I had made my own CSS for my site, but after using Bulma for a couple of months I decided it was time to use it on my own website. I really like the fact that it results in a minimal and clean looking design that works great on all screen sizes.

Bulma is now at version 0.5, with new features and updates added regularly and from the [github page](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/) it seems to have a big following, with over 19 thousand stars already.

Anyway, I hope you like the results of the update. I'm now thinking of what to work on next to keep improving the site!
