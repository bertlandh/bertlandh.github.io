After recently making a trip to Puerto Rico that was primarily focused on bird watching, I decided to write a blog post to pass on some of what we learned. Much of the information that we got from books or the Internet was outdated or incorrect, so hopefully this post will help others to have an easier time finding good places to bird there.

Incidentally, this trip [marked the occasion of adding my 800th bird species to my life list](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbGurEFs5WM/)!
