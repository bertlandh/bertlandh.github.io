# How did Marathons originate?

The modern marathon has it’s origin story in ancient Greece. A messenger named Philippides was tasked with bringing news of the Battle of Marathon to Athens, approximately 25 miles away. Once he reached the Acropolis and gave them the news that the Greeks had won, he died.

Fast forward to the 1896 Olympic games in Athens, and they decided to have a race retracing Philippides steps. So they organized a 25 mile race from Marathon to Athens and called it the “Marathon”

From there the distance fluctuated a bit between 24.85 miles and 26.56 miles as it was determined by the course set out by the organizers. But in 1908 during the London Olympics, they were going to have a 25 mile race, but the organizers decided to change the route to run past the Royal Box so they ended up with 26.2. After that there was still some fluctuation, until 1921 when the standard was set based upon the 1908 Olympic marathon distance.

## Exergic
In 490 BC, the Persian King, Darius, had a bone to pick with the Athenians.

Years before, the Ionians were revolting against the Persian empire and the Athenians supported the revolution.

King Darius was so infuriated he assigned one of his servants to whisper in his ear “Master, Remember the Athenians” three times before dinner each day. Talk about weird.

Darius sent his army to invade Athens, outnumbering them 6:1. The Athenians knew the battle couldn’t be won alone.

In an attempt to fend off the Persian forces, a man named Pheidippides was tasked to run 150 miles to request reinforcements from Sparta.

Back in the olden days, FaceTime did not exist so our Boy Pheidippides had quite the journey ahead and time was of the essence. Millions of lives were at stake.

Imagine running all day and night over leggo-like rocks and sewing needle thorns, barefoot, persisting on little more than figs, nuts, and olives.

He reached Sparta in 2 days.

Unfortunately, the Spartans were partying their faces off and religious rule forbade them from fighting for another 6 days.

Pheidippides had no time to take the thorns out of his feet let alone drink a celebratory beer. He needed to make a return trip to warn the Athenians that reinforcements would not be arriving in time.

With bloody feet and hamstrings clinging on, Pheidippides made his way to the outskirts of town and began the long journey back.

Another 150 miles in 2 days.

Without the Spartans, the Athenians saw little hope. If the Persians invaded Athens, everything would be gone. The Athenians decided to burn their city down rather than let the Persians have it.

But one General marched 25 miles to a strategic battlefield to attempt holding the Persians off.

With 10,000 men, General Miltiades met an army of 60,000 Persians.

The battlefield he chose protected his men from the infamous Persian cavalry - marshes and mountaineous terrain made this a fight for the ground.

General Miltiades lured the best Persian fighters into the middle of the battlefield and surrounded them with his flanks. The rest of the Persians panicked and ran back, being slaugthered in the process.

The Athenians won!

But the battle was not over.

The Athenians needed deliver the good news to their capital so the army didn’t return to a smoldering city.

Pheidippides was given his final task - run 25 miles from the battlefield back to the city of Athens to prevent them from burning their homes to the ground.

Upon reaching his destination, he stumbled into the city, uttering his last words before collapsing and dying of exhaustion.

What were his last words?

Nike.

In Greek mythology, Nike is the goddess of victory.

And the name of the battlefield?

Marathon.

The Athenians defeated the Persians at the Battle of Marathon - one of the turning points in the Greco-Persian Wars.

To celebrate the contributions of Pheidippides, Athens held its first organized marathon at the 1896 Olympics by having runner race 25 miles.

And we all know how popular a brand Nike is when it comes to sports footwear.

As for why the marathon changed from 25 to 26.2 miles - that’s a story that involves an English Queen and a nursery in 1908.
