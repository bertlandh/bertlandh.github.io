# Why do Pilots wear headphones?

{% include youtube.html video="EPL7jQXeMw0" %}

Aviation headsets fall into two broad categories: passive noise reduction and active noise reduction (ANR). The passive noise reduction headsets rely on a good seal around the ear and a strong clamping force.

ANR headsets must be powered to work properly but all ANR headsets still function without power as passive noise reducing headsets. Power for an ANR headset can come from a battery box or from aircraft power but not interchangeably. Aircraft power requires panel installation of a plug specific to the headset brand (a single connector provides power, headphone and microphone connections). The cable from the headset has 2 plugs (for airplanes) or one plug (for helicopters). These two plug styles are equivalent electronically, with the helicopter cable having an extra conductor in order to include the microphone and headphones in the same plug. The two-plug variant has one plug for the headphones and one of the microphone. These differ from gaming headsets in that the headphone plug is 0.25" (the kind a nice stereo receiver uses) and the microphone plug is 0.206". This difference in sizes is to avoid mixing up which plug goes in which jack.

The headset is connected to the airplanes audio panel. Audio panels vary in complexity but their basic job is to provide an intercom for communication between occupants of the airplane and access to the com radio for communication with ATC. The audio panel is also able to monitor (listen) the navigation radios certain types of beacons. In transport aircraft the audio panel is also tied into the passenger address system and the flight attendant's phones in the cabin.

The headsets can be operated in a hot mic setup or the mic can be explicitly turned on and off. The hot mic is the usual method and the audio panel provides a squelch control so you aren't broadcasting the cockpit noise when not talking. The ATC transmissions are via a push-to-talk (PTT) switch.
