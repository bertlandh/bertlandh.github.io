In my role as a Data Science and Data Curation Specialist at the Vanderbilt Libraries, I develop and present workshops and lessons to help beginner and intermediale-level learners develop skills for coding and using technical tools. These lessons are focused in three main areas: coding with Python and R, and using GitHub.

To view current lesson offerings, see the Digital Scholarship and Communications (DiSC) [Education and Training page](https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/disc/workshops).

# CodeGraf

Most lessons are organized around a self-paced system dubbed [CodeGraf](http://vanderbi.lt/codegraf). Each CodeGraf lesson contains a series of short 3-6 minute instructional videos, supplemented with TLDR main points and code snippets. The lesson concludes with a set of exercises for practice. A user can work through lesson series as part of a synchronous class, or make their own path through the lessons asynchronously in the style of "choose your own adventure".

# Python

The following [Python lesson series](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/codegraf/python/) are available in the CodeGraf format:

- [Introduction to coding with Python](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/codegraf/python/intro/) (Jupyter notebook-based)
- [Working with files and tables(including an introduction to Pandas)](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/codegraf/python/filestables/)
- [Introductory lesson for plotting with Pyplot](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/codegraf/010/)

I've also developed non-video materials for [using Python for web scraping and interacting with APIs](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/script/python/archive/#archive-of-apiweb-scraping-lessons---fall-2019).
