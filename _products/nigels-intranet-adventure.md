"Nigel brought his mug close to his mouth, holding the mug in both hands. He didn’t drink from it straight away, instead he shut his eyes and inhaled through his nose, breathing in the scent of his freshly made cup of coffee. He enjoyed the aroma for a short moment, before he tipped a mouthful of the warm, luxurious coffee into his mouth, savouring the different textures of the strong coffee mixed with the micro bubbles of hot frothy milk.

Nigel worked in an office for a large sales company, his desk in the corner, out of the way of the busy hustle and bustle of the sales and marketing teams. His official job title was 'Intranet Coordinator', but most people in the office didn't know what his job title was or what he actually did, just seeing him as the IT geek that sat in the corner. To be honest, Nigel didn't know what his job was either..."

Follow Nigel on an adventure that would change his life forever, all triggered by a chance encounter leading to a new friendship and a journey of technological wonder.
