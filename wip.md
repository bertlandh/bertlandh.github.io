# System and Network Administration

I've been helping companies with [Computer Life Support](https://bertlandh.github.io/) since 2009 by developing tools and educational resources to help others use automated deployments and remote installations more effectively.

## What is WIP?

WIP work in progress are requests from customers plus all the other tasks you need, want, or have to do, whether planned or unplanned.


## How does a ticket system improve our ability to track WIP?

A ticket system may improve our ability to track WIP based on the following; Requests are submitted electronically. Requests are stored in a database, they can be prioritized, assigned, and tracked. As the issue is worked on, the ticket is updated with notes and information. The system also records communication between the customer and the SA as the request is discussed or clarified. Work can be grouped and categorised based on the level on disruption it causes. Push system


### Sample Emergency Definitions

Here are some definitions of “emergency” [Computer Life Support](https://bertlandh.github.io/) uses:

• A server or service being down

• A user-facing issue that affects ten or more people

• A technical problem causing the company to “lose money fast”

• Customer proprietary data actively being leaked

• (At [Computer Life Support](https://bertlandh.github.io/)) anything that will directly prevent the Data from being accessed and edited by LTF Staff between 8:30 AM - 5:00PM


## In your organization, how do you ensure that SAs follow through on requests?

1 Custom focused hours first 2 hrs and last 2 hrs - handle customer requests 1st

2 Project focused hours half day for project work - handle projects 1st

3 Exception for service outages - (password reset) ask them to use another printer


## In your organization, if a piece of WIP has been ignored or progress has stalled, will this be noticed? If not, how could you fix this?

Yes, get supervisor to purchase [Computer Life Support](https://bertlandh.github.io/).
