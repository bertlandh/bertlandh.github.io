I really enjoy writing. I find it a great way to express myself. 

You can take your time and really think about what you want to say. I also enjoy helping people and I find writing is a great way of achieving this. 

I wanted to share what I have learnt throughout my time as a web developer and also my love of tech. I have written two books that are now available on the Amazon Kindle store.
