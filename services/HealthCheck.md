# HealthCheck

The IT Support HealthCheck is a low-cost approach for your support service to gain access to the unbiased opinion of top-tier IT support professionals. Both internal and external support workgroups (ITSM and ECSM) can use it. It also scans your second line in addition to the service desk or first line. 

Is your service as effective and economical as it possibly can be?
Is the personnel having as much fun as they possibly can?
Unexpectedly, those two frequently go together.

The more stimulating work environments typically produce the most successful support workgroups.
Because success generates success, most people desire to partake in it.
Any spectator at a successful sporting event or outstanding concert will tell you.
Ask any technician who is aware of their affiliation with a productive team of trustworthy coworkers.
