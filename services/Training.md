# Training for Internet Security

At Computer Life Support, we consider it a privilege to secure our digital lives, and as such, we aim to educate the public on all areas of cybersecurity.

That’s why we’ve created the I.S.E. (Internet Safety Education) Program. Our goal is to demystify cybersecurity through interactive learning and equip you with resources to have safer online experiences, become good digital citizens, and maybe even pursue careers in cybersecurity.

Courses consist of engaging and interactive learning, followed by an hour-long exam that, if passed, results in a certification. On the CLS website, the candidate's qualifications can be confirmed.
Each day of the course training is continuous and lasts from 09:30 to 16:30, with breaks for lunch and mid-afternoon.

Each course can accommodate up to 16 attendees. Pricing depends on numbers of attendees and location.
