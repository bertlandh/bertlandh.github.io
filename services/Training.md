# Training for Internet Security

The curriculum for authorized IT security training, "Internet Safety Education" was written by Bertland Hope. He provides four courses from that curriculum for delivery at your location while assuming the role of expert trainer. Courses consist of engaging and interactive learning, followed by an hour-long exam that, if passed, results in a certification. On the CLS website, the candidate's qualifications can be confirmed.
Each day of the course training is continuous and lasts from 09:30 to 16:30, with breaks for lunch and mid-afternoon.

Each course can accommodate up to 16 attendees. Pricing depends on numbers of attendees and location.
