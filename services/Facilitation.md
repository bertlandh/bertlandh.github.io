# Meeting Facilitation Service

This is an opportunity to have a knowledgeable contributor or leader for your meeting. Part consulting, part training. Can involve planning ahead of time to make the donation as promptly applicable as feasible. Additionally, this helps put the meeting's decisions and conclusions into action. The following is an illustration of a pre-scripted facilitation.

##### Game-Changing Strategies
Many system administration teams are having difficulties. They are attempting to climb their way out of a hole. If your team fits this description, Game-Changing Strategies can help. Even if your team doesn't fit this description, you'll still learn a lot about how effective teams maintain their success.
	
All successful sites share two characteristics that unsuccessful sites do not. The "Game-Changing Strategies" is a two- to three-day onsite engagement with one goal: getting those things perfect so that everything else falls into place.

For all organizations—and we do mean all—these two things are essentially the same. We travel the world, stopping at large and small, for-profit and nonprofit, wealthy and financially strapped venues. Some are so big that they have thousands of system administrators (SAs), while others are so little that they just have an occasional part-time information technology (IT) worker. These two characteristics are always present at the successful sites whereas they are absent from the unsuccessful ones.
