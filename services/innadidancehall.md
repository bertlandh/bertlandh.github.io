# Inna Di Dancehall: Popular Culture And the Politics of Identity in Jamaica

Inna di Dancehall provides an accessible account of a poorly understood and much maligned aspect of Jamaican popular culture. Donna Hope explores the sociopolitical meanings of Jamaica's dancehall culture. In particular, she gives an account of the power relations within the dancehall and between the dancehall and the wider Jamaican society. Hope allows the reader an unmatched insider's view and explanation of power, violence and gender relations in Jamaica as seen through the prism of dancehall.
